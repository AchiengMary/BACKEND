AI SOLAR HOT WATER TRIAGING & SIZING TOOL 

 

 Overall Goal 

Develop an AI-powered web application to streamline solar hot water system triaging, sizing, and quotation generation for sales engineers at Davis & Shirtliff. The tool will simplify the selection process by standardizing system sizing across different solar solutions, reducing complexity, and integrating with existing workflows. It will ensure consistency in recommendations, enhance efficiency in generating customer-friendly quotations, and support engineers with AI-driven insights for better decision-making.

 Problem Statement 

Sales engineers at Davis & Shirtliff’s handle a diverse range of solutions. Existing manual and semi-automated tools, require deep expertise and are not fully optimized for ease of use or adaptability. The limitations of the existing systems include:

•	Limited triaging capabilities: No structured way to determine customer needs, or how an existing system should be upgraded.

•	System sizing can be inconsistent, leading to inefficiencies, over-sizing, or under-sizing. Existing sizing tools are difficult to use and do not exist for all solar solutions.

•	The quotation process is time-consuming, with manual selection of components from the D&S product portfolio. Engineers often produce highly technical proposals instead of concise, customer-friendly one-page quotations that can be automatically converted into sales quotes in the ERP system.

•	Engineers must navigate multiple tools for different solar applications, increasing the learning curve for new hires.

•	Expansion planning and future-proofing considerations are often overlooked in initial system design.

 

 Solution 

Develop an AI-powered triaging and sizing tool that:

1.	Triage customer needs using an AI-driven interactive questionnaire tailored to different solar solutions.

2.	Simplifies and standardizes system sizing for the identified application areas, making it easy to use and update.

3.	Automates product selection and quotation by integrating with the D&S product portfolio for accurate recommendations.

4.	Produces a one-page quotation first, followed by a detailed proposal if needed.

5.	Generates ERP Sales quotes directly from sizing reports, ensuring a seamless transition from technical design to business case approval.

6.	Integrates AI-driven insights to assist engineers with training, best practices, and real-time recommendations.

 

 Challenges 

•	Data Gaps: Incomplete customer requirements data affects accurate system sizing.

•	Ease of use: Owing to the technical nature of products, it is essential to develop tools that are easy to use and have customer-friendly language. 

•	Integration: Aligning AI-enhanced tools with existing pricing databases, ERP systems, and sizing methodologies.

 

 Required Skillsets 

•	AI & Machine Learning

•	Web Development: Frontend and backend expertise for a scalable web-based platform.

•	API Development & Integration: Connecting with ERP.

•	Solar Energy Expertise: Understanding solar system sizing and optimization best practices.
