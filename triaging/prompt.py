                Analyze the following user query and generate 6 highly relevant questions to qualify their needs for a solar water heating solution:
                
                User Query: "{user_query}"
                
                TASK:
                Generate 6 specific questions that will help better understand this customer's requirements and constraints. These questions should be carefully tailored to the specific context of their query.
                
                INSTRUCTIONS:
                1. Each question must be unique and directly relevant to what is already mentioned or implied in the user query
                2. Questions should address information gaps in the user query - what hasn't been mentioned but is crucial to know
                3. Focus on technical specifications, implementation requirements, and customer expectations
                4. Format precisely as "Q1: [Question]", "Q2: [Question]", etc.
                5. Each question should be concise (10-20 words) and direct
                6. The last question should specificaly ask if the client wants  Solar Panels or Heat Pumps. This is very important to include.
                
                ESSENTIAL AREAS TO COVER (prioritize based on relevance to the query):
                • System capacity: Daily hot water volume needed, number of users, peak demand periods
                • Installation specifics: Available space, roof type, sun exposure, existing infrastructure
                • Budget parameters: Purchase limits, financing preferences, ROI expectations
                • Technical requirements: Temperature needs, pressure requirements, integration with existing systems
                • Implementation timeline: Installation deadlines, phasing requirements
                • Special considerations: Warranty expectations, maintenance concerns, certification requirements
                
                QUESTION TYPES TO INCLUDE:
                • At least one question about capacity/sizing
                • At least one question about budget
                • At least one question about installation timeline or constraints
                • Remaining questions should address specific technical requirements or integration needs
                
                EXAMPLES OF DIFFERENTIATED QUESTIONS FOR VARIOUS QUERIES:
                
                For general inquiry about options:
                - Focus on determining the scale of need and specific application environment
                - Ask about key decision factors and constraints
                
                For specific capacity requirements:
                - Focus on installation specifics and integration requirements
                - Ask about budget constraints and timeline expectations
                
                For commercial applications:
                - Focus on compliance requirements and maintenance expectations
                - Ask about capacity requirements more precisely (peak loads, usage patterns)
                
                RESPONSE FORMAT:
                Return ONLY the 6 numbered questions, formatted exactly as follows:
                Q1: [First question relevant to user query]
                Q2: [Second question relevant to user query]
                Q3: [Third question relevant to user query]
                Q4: [Fourth question relevant to user query]
                Q5: [Fifth question relevant to user query]
                Q6: [Sixth question as instructed, specifically asking about Solar Panels or Heat Pumps]
                
                Strictly follow the format above. Strictly Do not include any additional text or explanations. Stick to instructions and format provided.
